This writing assignment is the first part of your project.

Write a short proposal for your project reporting on any initial work you might have done. The report should include:

- Team members. If two or three students work together on the same project you should submit a single paper with all the names, indicating which parts each one wrote.  A project with more than one author is expected to be bigger to reflect the larger effort, and so the writing should also be longer.
- A brief description of the problem you intend to address and why it is interesting
- The approach you plan on taking to solve it
- The software you'll write or use
- Preliminary work or results (if any)
- How you will evaluate your solution
- A time frame for the work to be done
- Bibliographic references to a few relevant papers (3 or 4)
- The expected length is around 600-700 words. If you are working in a group, then we expect longer (800-900 for a group of 2, 1000+ for a group of 3.) With groups of 2-3, the expectation is that you will have multiple approaches to your problem, followed by a comparison of the different approaches, or address a more difficult problem that requires more explanation.

Note: If you use Grammarly or ChatGPT or another generative AI to assist with your work, we expect you to acknowledge that.

For some ideas, check out the final project description.

Grading criteria:
40% - Problem description and justification
30% - Description of approach
20% - Writing style (clarity, spelling errors, grammar, Latex correctness, etc.)
10% - Other required information (references, time frame)
